\begin{lem}
Suppose that $\Omega$ is a multiply connected domain with outer boundary
$\Gamma_{0}$ and $n-$ obstacle boundaries $\Gamma_{j}$, $j=1,2,\ldots n$. 
Suppose that $k$ is a Stokes eigenvalue for the region $\Omega$ and 
let $\bu$ be the corresponding eigenfunction. 
Then, the stream function associated with the velocity $\bu$ defined by
$w = \left(\nabla^{\perp} \right)^{-1} \bu$ exists and is single valued. 
Furthermore, $k$ is also a buckling eigenvalue if and only if
\begin{equation}
\int_{\Gamma_{j}} w\, ds = 0 \quad \forall j=1,2,\ldots n \, .
\end{equation}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Since $\bu$ is a Stokes eigenfunction, it satisfies
\begin{equation}
\int_{\Gamma_{j}} \bu \cdot \bn ds = 0 \quad j=0,1\ldots m \, .
\end{equation}
Thus, there exists a single valued stream function associated with the
velocity field $\bu$ such that 
\begin{equation}
\nabla^{\perp} w = \bu \, .
\end{equation}
Furthermore, since $\bu$ satisfies the oscillatory Stokes equations, 
$w$ satisfies
\begin{align}
\Delta (\Delta + k^{2} ) w &= 0 \, , \quad \bx \in \Omega \\
\nabla^{\perp} w = \bu &=0 \, ,\quad \bx \in \Gamma \, .
\end{align}
In particular $w= c_{j}$ for $\bx \in \Gamma_{j}$ for
some constant $c_{j}$, $j=0,1,2\ldots m$.
Thus $k$ is also a buckling eigenvalue if and only if 
\begin{equation}
c_{j} = \frac{1}{|\Gamma_{j}|}\int_{\Gamma_{j}} w ds =  0 \, .
\end{equation}
\end{proof}
