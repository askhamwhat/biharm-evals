\section{Introduction}

The planar incompressible Stokes equations describe
creeping flows in two dimensions. Let $\Omega \subset \R^2$
be a bounded domain with $C^2$ boundary. The eigenvalue problem seeks
values $k^2$ such that 

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  -\Delta \uu + \nabla p &= k^2 \uu \quad \textrm{in} \quad
  \Omega \label{eq:ostokes} \; , \\
  \nabla \cdot \uu &= 0 \; ,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
subject to boundary conditions, has a non-trivial solution $(\uu,p)$.
In this work, we consider the eigenvalue problem subject to 
the Dirichlet boundary condition,
\begin{equation}
  \uu = \bz \quad \textrm{on} \quad \Gamma \label{eq:ostokes_dir} \; .
\end{equation}
It is well known that there is a countable collection of such
values $0 < k_{1}^{2} \leq k_{2}^2 \leq \ldots \uparrow \infty$,
counting multiplicites.

\begin{remark}
  When $k = i\alpha$, the differential equation
  \cref{eq:ostokes} is known as the modified Stokes
  equation. As there appears to be no preferred
  name for the equation with real-valued $k$,
  we will refer to \cref{eq:ostokes} as the
  oscillatory Stokes equation.
\end{remark}
