### Stokes eigenvalues

This directory contains the code used to generate
the figures in the paper "A boundary integral equation 
approach to computing eigenvalues of the Stokes operator".
This repository is meant to be a snapshot of the
code as used in the paper.
The software development for this paper led to some
useful code which has been pulled out and will
be maintained more professionally under a different
name (more to come on this!)

### Compiling the mexfiles


From this top-level folder, run

```
make mexfiles
```
to generate the mexfiles used by the MATLAB
routines
